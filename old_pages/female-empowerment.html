          <h4>Equality through technology ðŸŒŽ</h4>
          <p>
          Gender inequality is a real thing... </br></br>
          Unfortunately that is still not clear to people. There are 190 heads of state - only 9 of them are women.
          Off all the people in parliament in the world, 13% are women.
          We believe that technology can change that.

          This is why we have a particular focus on empowering girls by teaching them to work with technology at their early ages.

      <h4>Teachers as role models</h4>
      <p>Over 70% of teachers in German schools are women. We believe those teachers can serve as role models.</p>
